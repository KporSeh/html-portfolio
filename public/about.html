<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Solomon Kpormen Klee, and I’m currently an intern web developer based in Liberia. I recently embarked on my web development journey, diving into a course by Angela Yu on Udemy. Even though I started just a few days ago, the experience has already been incredibly rewarding.</p>

<p>Learning web development has opened up a world of creativity and problem-solving for me. I’m excited about the potential to build interactive websites and applications that can make a difference in my community and beyond.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I’m eager to expand my skills further and begin building a portfolio that showcases my projects and abilities. I believe that hands-on experience is essential in this field, so I’m looking forward to taking on new challenges and collaborating with others. I’m passionate about continuous learning and am excited to see where this journey takes me!</p>
